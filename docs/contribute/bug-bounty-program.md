Candle looks forward to working with the community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our **Projects**, **Developers** and **Users** safe.

The bounty program is to ensure everyone has an opportunity to find bugs in our system, which will in turn help us ensure the security of Candle. Payouts will go up to $10,000 for critical issues.

## Getting Started
* If you are new to blockchains and/or to Candle, take a look at the Candle overview - https://docs.candlelabs.org/docs/home/architecture/candle-architecture/

* Explore the code on GitHub there are 3 main repositories for you to study
Heimdall - https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall
Bor - https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
Contracts - https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts

## Setting up
* Set up a test network locally with these instructions: Getting Started - Running a node on the local environment: https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic-cli

The Candle CLI repo is an easy way to setup and manage the entire Candle stack, including **Heimdall**, **Bor** and the **Staking & Plasma smart contracts** on a local environment. This would help in simulating tests and attacks locally.
