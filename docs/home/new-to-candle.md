## What is a Blockchain?
Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Head over to [Blockchain Basics](blockchain-basics/blockchain) to read more.

## What is a Sidechain?
Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a 'parent' blockchain, supporting transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

## Validator and delegator roles

On the Candle Network, you can be a validator or a delegator. See:

* [Who Is a Validator](/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator)
* [Who Is a Delegator](/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-delegator)

## Architecture

If your goal is to become a validator, it is essential that you understand the Candle architecture.

See [Candle Architecture](/docs/validate/validator/architecture).

### Components

To have a granular understanding of the Candle architecture, see core components:

* [Heimdall](/docs/contribute/heimdall/overview)
* [Bor](/docs/contribute/bor/overview)
* [Contracts](/docs/contribute/contracts/stakingmanager)

#### Codebases

* [Contracts](https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts)

## How-tos

### Node setup

* [Run a Validator Node with Ansible](/docs/validate/validate/run-validator-ansible)
* [Run a Validator Node from Binaries](/docs/validate/validate/run-validator-binaries)
